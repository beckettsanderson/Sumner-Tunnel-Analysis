The closing of a major thoroughfare in Boston, the Sumner Tunnel, caused large transportation changes for the MBTA as over 40,000 daily travelers had to adjust their routine. This project analyzed changes in ridership with a focus on the blue and orange rail lines, to contribute to the MBTA Travel Behavior Memo. Using timestamp data to view ridership before an after the closing of the tunnel, calculated percentage change of ridership on both the overall line level and narrowed down to individual stops on each line. In addition, evaluated the data for any missing tracking data and communicated the necessary updates.
